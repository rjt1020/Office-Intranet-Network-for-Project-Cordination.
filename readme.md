Office Intranet Network for Project Cordination.

Using this network the project leader can assign the modules which have to be done in the project to the respective team member. Once the team member comes to work, they can easily know the work assigned to him/her by checking the network. This information can be accessed by the team member with the help of his personal username and password. The respective team member can view his project name and his/her role in the project and time duration in which he/she have to complete the project.
 Once any team member gets the project assignment mail then they can interact with our private network and can do their daily assigned task at any time. Here the project leader and project team member have their individual section for their processing. Using the admin section the project leader can assign the roles to the respective team members for the projects.
 Users can interact with the network through user section. Here they can view all the files and folders, which are uploaded by them. If they have the permission to delete the file it can be done remotely.
Clients can also interact with this network with their username and password and can access the roles assigned to them.
