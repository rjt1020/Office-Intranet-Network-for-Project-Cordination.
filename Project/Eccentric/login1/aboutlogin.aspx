                Eccentric Network is mainly used in software companies. Because many people are involved in
                completition of a project. People like team leader, project leader,Team members..etc. Team members should finish their dalily task and their
                source code should be stored in the main server. This is the day-to-day&nbsp; task done by the team members.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                <br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Project
                Leader assigns modules for the team members. These are informed to the members manually
                If the team member or the team leader is not in the office they both can't perform any
                task. So here we developed a private
                network for the team leader and the team member.<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Using this network
                the project leader can assign the projects to the respective team members.This information
                contains the team member&#39;s network id and password with project name and
                the role of them in the project and time
                duration of the project.Once any team member got the project assignment mail, they 
                can
                interact with our private network and
                they can do their daily task at any time</span></strong>.<br />
